FULL LOCUST  

Chin forward, reach your arms out to the sides.  
Palms down, five fingers together.  
Stretch from fingertips to fingertips.  
Squeeze your legs together, point your toes.  
This time the arms and legs lift up at the same time.  
Make up your mind to give all of your effort for 10 seconds.  
Ready? Inhale, lift up.  
Look up, arms up, legs up.  
Look at the ceiling. Look back.  
Chin up.  
Thighs off the floor, legs higher.  
Point your toes.  
Lock your knees.  
Lift your thighs and rib cage off the floor.  
Hands higher than the head.  
Lift the arms higher, lift the legs higher.  
Lift up, go up, look up.  
Lift up one more time.  
Change.  
Look to the right side.  
Left ear on the towel.  
Arms by your side.
