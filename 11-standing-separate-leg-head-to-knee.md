Inhale, arms over the head.  
Put your palms together, cross your thumbs.  
Arms straight, stretch up to the ceiling.  
Elbows locked, arms touching the ears.  
Take a big step to the right, at least three feet.  
Pivot on your heels to the right side.  
Front foot, point forward.  
Back foot, turn out 45 degrees, heel on the same line.  
Bring your left hip forward until both hips face forward evenly.  
Bring it a little extra forward,  
more than you think.  
Take a deep breath,  
Lower your chin to your throat.  
Stretch up again.  
Abdomen in.  
Exhale, round down from the top to the bottom.  
Upper spine, middle spine, lower spine.  
Put your forehead exactly on your right knee.  
Forehead should touch the knee, bend the kee if necessary.  
Arms straight, fingertips touch the floor in front of the toes.  
Palms flat together,  
Only separate your hands if needed to balance.  
Back leg straight, lock the knee, heel on the floor.  
Pull your abdomen in.  
Push your hands against the floor to get your right knee locked.  
Shift the weight forward into the right foot,  
Right hip up, left hip down.  
Hips level.  
Lock the knees very quick at the end.  
Inhale breathing, gently come up, arms and head together.  
Pivot forwards, and then pivot to the left side.
