SIT UP  

Next is a sit-up.  
The sit-up should be quick and explosive.  
Toes and heels together. Flex your feet, keep your heels on the floor.  
Arms over your head, cross your thumbs, arms and head together.  
Deep breath, abdomen in ..  
Sit-up!  
Reach forward.  
Pull on your toes.  
Double Exhale.  
Forehead to the knees, elbows to the floor.
