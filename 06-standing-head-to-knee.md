STANDING HEAD TO KNEE  
  
Stand with your feet together.  
Shift your weight to your left leg.  
Lift your right foot.  
Pull your abdomen in and reach for the foot. 
Interlock your fingers under the ball of the foot, thumbs included.  
Look in the mirror.  
From start to finish: concentrate one point on your left knee in the mirror, to make sure the knee is absolutely locked to begin with.  
Your left leg should be solid, concrete, one-piece, lamp-post, unbroken.  
NO KNEE!!!  
Inhale breathing: slowly, gently, right leg lift up and stretch forward towards the mirror, until the leg is exactly parallel to the floor. No higher, no lower.  
Left knee LOCKED.  
Take a deep breath, continuously kick your right legâ€“heel forward towards the mirror, so you can turn your right foot in from the ankle towards your face, with all 5 toes turning in.  
Still, the standing leg is the most important part.  
Straighten the standing leg again. Lock the knee.  
Kick your right heel out, turn your toes in. Try to get both knees locked.  
If both knees are locked, and still you can balance there comfortably, then, only,   
pull your abdomen in,  
bend your elbows down toward the floor, until your elbows are touching the calf muscle.  
Eventually, your elbows should go down below the calf muscle.  
Change.   
Slowly reverse one step at a time.  
Put your feet back together.

Optionally put your hands on your hips and do a quick back bend.
