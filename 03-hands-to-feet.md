HANDS TO FEET  

Bend your knees, put your hands on the floor in front of you.  
One at a time, bend the knees, to release the lower back.  
As you bend the right, straighten the left.  
As you bend the left, straighten the right.  
Move your hips up and down as you walk in place.  
Now bend both knees.  
Reach around and slide your five fingers underneath your heels from behind,   
Get a good grip on the heels.  
Bend your elbows and reach them behind your calves.  
Pull on your heels.  
Touch your upper body and legs together  
\- abdomen on thighs, chest on knees, face to the shins. 
There should be no gap anywhere.  
Pull on your heels, use your arm strength.  
Lift your hips up and straighten your legs,  
Create a tremendous stretch in the back of the legs.  
Make sure the upper body and legs are still touching.  
Don't let the chest separate from the knees.  
Reach your elbows back more.  
Pull on your heels,  
Roll the weight forward to your toes.  
When your legs are straight, contract the leg muscles.  
Lift your hips up, straighten your legs more.  
Try to lock your knees.  
Reach the top of your head toward the floor.  
Stretch your spine.  
Touch your face. Lock your knees.  
Pull with your arms and straighten your legs,  
One more time, pull, straighten your legs, stretch your spine.  
Lock your knees, lock your knees.  
Inhale breathing, come up, arms and head together.  
Arms down by your sides, relax.
