FIXED FIRM  

Put your chin on the floor, your hands under your shoulders and push yourself up.  
Start in a kneeling position.  
Knees together.  
Separate your feet as wide as your hips.  
Sit down between your feet,  
until your hips are on the floor.  
From start to finish keep your knees on the floor. 
and your heels touching the hips.  
If it bothers the knees or ankles, stop, back up.  
open the knees to make it more comfortable, try again.  
Go step by step.  
If you can, put your hands-palms on your toes, thumbs inside, fingers outside.  
Relax the head back.  
If you can, touch your right elbow on the floor, then the left, one by one.  
Touch your head on the floor, then the back of your head.  
Your shoulders can touch the floor.  
Whole upper body relaxed on the floor.  
Bring your arms over your head.  
Grip your elbows above your head.  
Press your elbows to the floor.  
Chin down to your chest.  
Lift your chest and abdomen up towards the ceiling, create a perfect human bridge.  
Eyes open, breathing normal.  
Eventually, bring your knees together, touching each other, but make sure knees never come off the floor.  
Put your hands on your feet, with the help of the elbows, carefully come up. Head up last.  
Turn around, lie down on your back, and relax. Savasana.
