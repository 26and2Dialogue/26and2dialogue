FINAL SAVASANA  

Turn around and lie down on your back for Final Savasana.  
In this practice, you create the benefits in the asanas, you absorb and assimilate those benefits in the savasanas.  
Close your eyes.  
Completely surrender one more time.  
Inhale, let the belly rise.  
Exhale, let the belly fall.  
This class is uncomfortable and difficult, but it is effective.  
Acknowledge all of your effort and hard work.  
Take your time.  
Enjoy your Final Savasana.  
If you have any questions, see me on the way out.  
Namaste.
