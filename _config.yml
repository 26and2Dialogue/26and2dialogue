# Callouts
# 
# The title of a callout is optional. It is rendered in uppercase.
# 
# Each kind of callout has a color, used for the callout bar, the title, and the background.
# Predefined colors: grey-lt, grey-dk, purple, blue, green, yellow, red.
# If you use another color, you should define its levels (000, 100, 200, 300) in _sass/custom/custom.scss.
#
# The default is for callout backgrounds to have a lower color level than the bars and titles.
# The value of `callouts_level` is either `quiet` or `loud`:
# `loud` increases the saturation and lightness of the backgrounds.
# The default for `callouts_level` is `quiet` when using the `light` or custom color schemes,
# and `loud` when using the `dark` color scheme.

# callouts_opacity: 0.15
# callouts_level: loud
