HEAD TO KNEE WITH STRETCHING  

Turn around and sit facing the front mirror.  
Straighten your right leg, right foot on the right side of your mat.  
Bend your left knee and press the sole of your foot to your inner thigh,  
heel to the groin.  
Arms over your head, turn to the right and reach for the right foot.  
Interlock your fingers under the ball of your right foot, thumbs included.  
Pull back on the foot.  
Flex your foot and lock your knee, so your heel comes off the floor.  
Lower your chin to your throat, look at your belly button.  
Pull your abdomen in, round your spine, forehead exactly on your right knee.  
If you can't touch your forehead, bend your knee up a little bit.  
Forehead should touch the knee.  
Bend your elbows to the sides of the calf muscles.  
With the forehead and the knee touching, straighten your right leg.  
Don't let the forehead separate from the knee.  
Left elbow down more. Left shoulder down more.  
Roll inside to the left.   
Pull your abdomen in.  
Bring your forehead closer one more time.  
Push your knee down.  
Change.  
Come up.
