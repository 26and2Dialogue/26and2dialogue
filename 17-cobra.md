COBRA  

Turn around. Lie on your belly.  
Chin forward.  
Put your palms flat on the floor underneath your shoulders.  
Fingertips in line with the tops of the shoulders,  
little fingers in line with the outsides of the shoulders.  
Flatten your hands on the floor, five fingers together.  
Start to finish, keep your feet and heels together, and tops of the feet flat on the floor.  
Leg muscles nice and tight, buttock muscles contracted.  
Squeeze your legs together.  
You have only one leg, like a Cobra. Don't open it.  
Forearms touching the body, drop your shoulders down.  
Look up towards the ceiling.  
Inhale breathing, come up please. Lift your upper body up, using your 100% back strength.  
Come up half way only, until only your belly button is touching the floor. The rest of your upper body is in the air.  
From the side, your elbows should be a ninety-degree angle.  
Stretch your elbows down towards the hips, arms and elbows always touching the body, [to bring your shoulders down], trapezius muscles visible.  
Now chest up more, everybody go up[, come up a couple of inches].  
Shoulders down, chest up, look up, come up, go up, more up, come up a little more and hold it there. Freeze.  
And gently come down.  
Left ear on the towel, arms by your side, and relax.
