SPINE TWISTING  

Sit facing the left side of the room.  
Bend your left knee on the floor, left knee facing the left side mirror.  
Left heel to the right hip.  
Point the right toes.  
Bring your right heel over the left knee.  
Heel touching the knee. Foot flat on the floor.  
Both sitbones touching the floor comfortably, to keep your spine perfectly straight up and down.  
Bring your left arm over the right knee, elbow exactly against the knee.  
Push your knee back, with the help of your left elbow.  
Turn your wrist, and grip the bottom knee-top with your left hand.   
Or, reach for the mat/towel.   
Stretch your spine up.  
Right hand behind your back, palm facing out.  
Reach for the thigh behind you with your right hand fingertips.  
Or, just put your right hand on the floor behind you and push against the floor to keep your spine straight up.  
Chest up, spine up, rib cage open.  
Look back behind you, look over your right shoulder, way, way, way back, chin over your shoulder.  
Twist your body right side, all the way.  
Total spine is supposed to twist, top to bottom.  
Coccyx to the neck, joints of each and every vertebrae and cartilage supposed to twist, like a pearl necklace.  
Twist, and twist, and twist, your last chance - twist.  
Change.  
[LEFT SIDE]  
Turn around, lie down on your back. Savasana.
