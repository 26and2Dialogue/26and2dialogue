TRIANGLE. 

Inhale, arms up over the head.  
Take a very big step to the right, arms down parallel to the floor.  
Push your hips forward and bring your arms back,  
Pull your abdomen in. Spine straight.  
Turn your right foot 90-degrees to the right.  
Keep your heels on the same line.  
Bend your right leg knee to a 90-degree angle. Sit down all the way.  
Stay down low.  
Lock the left leg knee.   
Make sure your hips don't go up any more. Stay down there.  
Again, hips forward, arms back, body back, lean back, open your chest, spine straight in the centre.  
Inhale, move your both arms.  
Reach down with your right arm. Reach up with your left arm.  
Put the right elbow in front of the right knee, no lower than the knee.  
Turn your head to the left side.  
Put your chin on your shoulder.  
Left arm, reach straight up towards the ceiling.  
Right fingers, reach to the space between the big toe and the second toe.  
Don't touch the floor.  
Arms and shoulders stretching each other, up and down, in opposite directions like natural human traction.  
Push back on the right knee with the right elbow.  
Left hip forward slightly.  
Turn and twist your upper body to the left.  
Turn your head more, so the profile of your face is exactly visible in the mirror.  
Straighten the left leg, left foot flat on the floor.  
Reach down with your right arm. Reach up with your left arm.  
Turn and twist to the left.  
Change.  
Arms return parallel to the floor.  
Then straighten the right leg, pivot forward.
