Fingers inside and thumbs outside.  
Very important, hold on tight.  
Lower your chin to your throat and look at your belly.

Exhale, pull your abdomen in, round forward and down.  
Keep pulling on your heels.  
Touch your forehead on the front of the knees.  
Automatically, the top of your head touching the floor.  
Not too much weight on the head.  
Lift your hips up, all the way, as high as possible.  
Hold your heels tight.  
Roll forward like a wheel until your arms/elbows are straight.  
If there's a gap between your knees and forehead, walk your knees one by one, minimize the gap.  
Make sure the total spine is stretching from the top to bottom.  
Eyes open, breathing normal.  
One more time, hold tight, hips up more.  
Come up, uncurl your spine. Head up last.  
Turn around, lie down on your back, Savasana.
