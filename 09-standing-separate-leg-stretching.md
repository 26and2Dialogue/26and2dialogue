STANDING SEPARATE LEG STRETCHING. 

Feet together. Arms over the head sideways.  
Take a big step to the right, arms down parallel to the floor.  
If your forehead was touching the floor easily, bring your feet closer together, only as much as you need.  
Turn your toes in slightly, feet parallel.  
Pull your abdomen in and slowly fold forward  
from the hips with a straight spine.  
Look forward in the mirror, come all the way forward and down.  
Grip the outside of the heels.  
Five fingers under the heels.  
If you cannot reach the feet, just put your hands on the floor.  
Straighten the legs, lock the knees, and contract the quadriceps muscles.  
Pull on your heels as strongly as possible, stretching your body down from the lower back, towards the floor.  
Make sure your knees are locked throughout the posture.  
Roll forward, body weight on the toes.  
Aim your chest to the floor.  
Try to touch your forehead to the floor.  
If you cannot touch your forehead to the floor, open your legs more, and more and more.  
Elbows close to the legs. Keep pulling.  
Eventually your spine should be perfectly straight from the coccyx to the neck, forehead touching the floor between the feet.  
Pull harder, keep pulling.  
Chin forward, roll forward.  
Touch your forehead to the floor.  
Inhale breathing, slowly come up. Right leg back to the place.  
Arms down side.
